"""Minimum node-cover problem can be described as, given an undirected graph G = (V,E), finding
the smallest subset S âŠ† V such that each edge in E is incident to at least one node of S. Devise a greedy algorithm to find the
node cover for any given undirected graph. You can assume that you will be given only the adjacency matrix corresponding to
an undirected graph, which shows whether there is an edge between any two nodes in the graph. Since this is a greedy algorithm, it may not generate the optimum (i.e., minimum-sized) node-cover, however, any
generated solution by the greedy algorithm is still expected to be a node-cover."""
